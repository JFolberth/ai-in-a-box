  - Ask the user to share what they learn for future reference
```

### Testing Your Instructions

**1. Start with Edge Cases**
- Ask questions outside the agent's intended scope
- Test with ambiguous or incomplete requests
- Try to get the agent to break character or ignore instructions

**2. Verify Consistency**
- Ask the same question multiple ways
- Test with different user experience levels
- Check responses across different session

**3. Check Tone and Style**
- Ensure responses match your brand voice
- Verify appropriate formality level

## üöÄ Deployment and Testing Workflow

## üöÄ Deployment and Testing Workflow

### Step-by-Step Agent Deployment Process

Follow this workflow to safely deploy and test agent customizations:

#### 1. Edit Agent Configuration

**Location**: `/home/runner/work/ai-in-a-box/ai-in-a-box/src/agent/ai_in_a_box.yaml`

```bash
# Open the agent configuration file
code src/agent/ai_in_a_box.yaml

# Or use any text editor
nano src/agent/ai_in_a_box.yaml
```

**Best Practices**:
- Make incremental changes rather than complete rewrites
- Test one change at a time (e.g., just instructions, then model parameters)
- Keep a backup of working configurations
- Use descriptive commit messages for version control

#### 2. Validate YAML Syntax

**Manual Validation**:
```bash
# Check YAML syntax (requires python-yaml)
python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('src/agent/ai_in_a_box.yaml'))"

# Using online validator
# Copy content to: https://yamlchecker.com/
```

**VS Code Validation**:
- Install "YAML" extension by Red Hat
- The schema reference provides automatic validation
- Look for red squiggly lines indicating errors

**Common Syntax Issues**:
- Incorrect indentation (YAML is sensitive to spaces)
- Missing quotes around special characters
- Invalid array syntax (use `[]` or proper list format)
- Multi-line string formatting (use `|` for literal blocks)

#### 3. Deploy to AI Foundry

**Prerequisites**:
- Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login`)
- Appropriate permissions to AI Foundry resources
- AI Foundry endpoint URL from your deployment

**Deployment Command**:
```powershell
# Basic deployment
./deploy-scripts/Deploy-Agent.ps1 -AiFoundryEndpoint "https://your-ai-foundry-endpoint.com/api/projects/yourProject"

# With custom agent name override
./deploy-scripts/Deploy-Agent.ps1 `
  -AiFoundryEndpoint "https://your-ai-foundry-endpoint.com/api/projects/yourProject" `
  -AgentName "Custom Agent Name"

# Force update existing agent
./deploy-scripts/Deploy-Agent.ps1 `
  -AiFoundryEndpoint "https://your-ai-foundry-endpoint.com/api/projects/yourProject" `
  -Force

# JSON output for automation
./deploy-scripts/Deploy-Agent.ps1 `
  -AiFoundryEndpoint "https://your-ai-foundry-endpoint.com/api/projects/yourProject" `
  -OutputFormat "json"
```

**Finding Your AI Foundry Endpoint**:
```bash
# List AI Foundry resources
az cognitiveservices account list --query "[?kind=='AIServices']" --output table

# Get specific endpoint
az cognitiveservices account show --name "your-ai-foundry-name" --resource-group "your-rg" --query "properties.endpoint" --output tsv
```

#### 4. Verify Deployment

**Check Deployment Status**:
```bash
# Look for deployment success message
echo $LASTEXITCODE  # Should be 0 for success

# Check agent exists in AI Foundry
az rest --method GET --url "https://your-endpoint/api/agents" --headers "Authorization=Bearer $(az account get-access-token --query accessToken -o tsv)"
```

**AI Foundry Portal Verification**:
1. Open [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/)
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to "Agents" section
4. Verify your agent appears with correct name and description
5. Test basic functionality using the built-in chat interface

#### 5. Test Agent Behavior

**Basic Functionality Test**:
```bash
# Test via the deployed SPA interface
# Navigate to your Static Web App URL
# Example: https://your-spa.azurestaticapps.net
```

# Check Application Insights for errors or performance issues
az monitor app-insights component show --app "your-app-insights" --resource-group "your-rg"

# View recent telemetry
az monitor app-insights query --app "your-app-insights" --analytics-query "requests | where timestamp > ago(1h) | project timestamp, name, success, duration"
```

**User Feedback Collection**:
- Monitor chat logs for common issues or confusion
- Collect feedback on response quality and helpfulness
- Track escalation rates and resolution success
- Note any requests for features or capabilities not supported

**Iterative Improvement Process**:
1. **Analyze Usage Patterns**: What questions are users asking most?
2. **Identify Pain Points**: Where is the agent struggling or providing poor responses?
3. **Refine Instructions**: Update prompts based on real-world usage
4. **Test Changes**: Deploy and monitor impact of modifications
5. **Document Learnings**: Keep notes on what works and what doesn't

#### 7. Rollback Procedures

**If Deployment Fails**:
```bash
# Check deployment logs
./deploy-scripts/Deploy-Agent.ps1 -AiFoundryEndpoint "your-endpoint" -OutputFormat "json" 2>&1 | tee deployment.log

# Restore previous working configuration
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/agent/ai_in_a_box.yaml
./deploy-scripts/Deploy-Agent.ps1 -AiFoundryEndpoint "your-endpoint" -Force
```

**If Agent Behavior is Problematic**:
```bash
# Quick revert to known good version
git log --oneline -- src/agent/ai_in_a_box.yaml  # Find last good commit
git checkout <commit-hash> -- src/agent/ai_in_a_box.yaml
./deploy-scripts/Deploy-Agent.ps1 -AiFoundryEndpoint "your-endpoint" -Force
```

### Local Testing (Development)

**When Possible**:
- Test prompt changes with OpenAI playground or similar tools
- Use AI Foundry Studio for rapid prototyping
- Create test scenarios with expected responses
- Validate tool configurations work as intended

**Limitations**:
- Full SPA integration requires deployed environment
- Authentication and security features may not work locally
- Performance characteristics may differ from production

### Automation and CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions Integration**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-agent.yml
name: Deploy AI Agent
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'src/agent/ai_in_a_box.yaml'
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy-agent:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Azure Login
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
      
      - name: Deploy Agent
        run: |
          chmod +x deploy-scripts/Deploy-Agent.ps1
          pwsh deploy-scripts/Deploy-Agent.ps1 -AiFoundryEndpoint "${{ secrets.AI_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT }}" -OutputFormat "json"
```

```bash
# Development environment
./deploy-scripts/Deploy-Agent.ps1 -AiFoundryEndpoint "$DEV_ENDPOINT" -AgentName "AI Assistant (Dev)"

# Staging environment  
./deploy-scripts/Deploy-Agent.ps1 -AiFoundryEndpoint "$STAGING_ENDPOINT" -AgentName "AI Assistant (Staging)"

# Production environment
./deploy-scripts/Deploy-Agent.ps1 -AiFoundryEndpoint "$PROD_ENDPOINT" -AgentName "AI Assistant"
```

## üîß Advanced Configuration Options

### Tool Integration

#### File Search Configuration

Enable file search when your agent needs to access uploaded documents, knowledge bases, or reference materials.

```yaml
tools: ["file_search"]

file_search:
  max_num_results: 20           # Number of relevant chunks to retrieve (1-50)
  ranking_options:
    ranker: "default_2024_05_13"  # Ranking algorithm version
    score_threshold: 0.0          # Minimum relevance score (0.0-1.0)
```

**Use Cases**:
- Customer support with product documentation
- Compliance agents with policy documents
- Technical support with troubleshooting guides
- Educational assistants with course materials

**Best Practices**:
- Upload well-structured documents (PDFs, Word docs, text files)
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Organize content logically with headers and sections
- Keep documents updated and remove outdated information
- Test search relevance with common user queries

**File Preparation Tips**:
```markdown
# Good document structure for file search
# Title: Clear, descriptive title
# Table of Contents (for long documents)

## Section 1: Overview
Clear introduction and scope

## Section 2: Detailed Content
Well-organized information with subheadings

### Subsection 2.1: Specific Topic
Detailed information with examples

## Section 3: Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions

## References
Links to additional resources
```

#### Code Interpreter Configuration

Enable code execution for data analysis, calculations, and programming tasks.

```yaml
tools: ["code_interpreter"]

code_interpreter:
  auto_run_enabled: false       # Whether to automatically execute generated code
  timeout_seconds: 120          # Maximum execution time (60-600 seconds)
```

**Use Cases**:
- Data analysis and visualization
- Mathematical calculations and modeling
- File format conversions
- API testing and development
- Educational programming assistance

**Capabilities**:
- Python code execution in a sandboxed environment
- File upload and processing (CSV, JSON, images, etc.)
- Data visualization with matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- Scientific computing with numpy, pandas, scipy
- Basic machine learning with scikit-learn

**Security Considerations**:
- Code runs in an isolated sandbox environment
- No internet access from code execution environment
- File access is limited to uploaded files
- Execution time is bounded by timeout settings

**Example Usage Instructions**:
```yaml
instructions: |
  When users request data analysis or calculations, use the code interpreter to:
  
  1. **Always explain your approach** before writing code
  2. **Write clean, well-commented Python code**
  3. **Show intermediate results** with print statements
  4. **Create visualizations** when they help explain findings
  5. **Interpret results** in plain language
  
  Code Writing Standards:
  - Use descriptive variable names
  - Add comments explaining complex logic
  - Handle potential errors gracefully
  - Validate input data before processing
  - Create publication-ready plots with proper labels
```

#### Combined Tool Usage

```yaml
tools: ["file_search", "code_interpreter"]

instructions: |
  You have access to both file search and code execution capabilities:
  
  **File Search**: Use when users ask about documented procedures, policies, or reference information
  **Code Interpreter**: Use for calculations, data analysis, or when users provide datasets
  **Combined**: Search for relevant documentation first, then implement solutions in code
  
  Example workflow:
  1. Search documentation for relevant procedures or examples
  2. Use code to implement the solution or perform calculations
  3. Reference documentation to validate approach and provide additional context
```

### Model Performance Tuning

#### Parameter Optimization

**Temperature Tuning**:
```yaml
model:
  options:
    # Conservative (factual, consistent responses)
    temperature: 0.1  # Technical documentation, customer support
    
    # Balanced (slight variation, professional)
    temperature: 0.3  # General business applications
    
    # Creative (varied responses, brainstorming)  
    temperature: 0.7  # Marketing content, ideation sessions
    
    # Highly creative (unpredictable, experimental)
    temperature: 0.9  # Creative writing, artistic projects
```

**Response Control**:
```yaml
model:
  options:
    max_tokens: 4000              # Maximum response length
    presence_penalty: 0.1         # Reduce repetitive content
    frequency_penalty: 0.1        # Encourage topic diversity
    top_p: 0.9                   # Word selection diversity
    stop: ["END_RESPONSE"]        # Custom stop sequences
```

**Deterministic Responses** (for testing):
```yaml
model:
  options:
    temperature: 0.0
    seed: 42                     # Same seed = identical responses
    top_p: 1.0
```

#### Model Selection Guidelines

**gpt-4o-mini** (Recommended for most use cases):
- **Best for**: General chat, customer support, basic Q&A
- **Pros**: Fast, cost-effective, good quality
- **Cons**: Less capable with complex reasoning
- **Cost**: ~10x cheaper than GPT-4o

**gpt-4o**:
- **Best for**: Complex analysis, code review, technical documentation
- **Pros**: Superior reasoning, better code generation, multi-modal
- **Cons**: Higher cost, slower response times
- **Cost**: Premium pricing

**gpt-4-turbo**:
- **Best for**: Balance of capability and speed
- **Pros**: Good reasoning, faster than GPT-4o, handles longer contexts
- **Cons**: More expensive than mini models
- **Cost**: Mid-range pricing

**Selection Matrix**:
```yaml
# Simple FAQ or basic support
model:
  id: gpt-35-turbo
  options:
    temperature: 0.2

# General business applications
model:
  id: gpt-4o-mini
  options:
    temperature: 0.3

# Complex technical tasks  
model:
  id: gpt-4o
  options:
    temperature: 0.1
    max_tokens: 4000

# Creative or brainstorming tasks
model:
  id: gpt-4o
  options:
    temperature: 0.8
    max_tokens: 3000
```

### Response Format Control

#### Structured Output

Force JSON responses for programmatic consumption:

```yaml
response_format:
  type: "json_object"

instructions: |
  Always respond with valid JSON in this format:
  {
    "answer": "Your response text",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "sources": ["source1", "source2"],
    "next_steps": ["step1", "step2"]
  }
```

#### Consistent Formatting

```yaml
instructions: |
  Always format responses using this structure:
  
  ## Summary
  Brief overview of the response
  
  ## Detailed Answer  
  Comprehensive information with examples
  
  ## Additional Resources
  - Link 1: Description
  - Link 2: Description
  
  ## Next Steps
  1. Immediate action to take
  2. Follow-up considerations
```

### Integration Patterns

#### Multi-Agent Workflows

```yaml
# Specialist agent that can hand off to other agents
instructions: |
  You are a triage agent that determines the best specialist for each request:
  
  **Technical Issues**: Escalate to DevOps Specialist
  **Security Questions**: Escalate to Security Auditor  
  **Documentation**: Escalate to Documentation Assistant
  **General Support**: Handle directly
  
  When escalating, provide:
  1. Summary of the user's request
  2. Any relevant context or constraints
  3. Specific questions the specialist should address
```

#### External System Integration

```yaml
instructions: |
  When users request information that requires external systems:
  
  1. **Acknowledge the request** and explain what you need to check
  2. **Provide guidance** on how they can get the information
  3. **Offer to help interpret** results once they have them
  4. **Suggest automation** if this is a frequent request
  
  Example: "I'll need to check our ticketing system for that information. 
  You can find this in [System] ‚Üí [Menu] ‚Üí [Reports]. Once you have the data, 
  I can help you analyze it and suggest next steps."
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### Common YAML Configuration Issues

#### Syntax Errors

**Problem**: Invalid YAML syntax
```yaml
# ‚ùå Wrong - incorrect indentation
name: AI Assistant
instructions:
You are a helpful assistant.

# ‚úÖ Correct - proper indentation and multi-line syntax
name: AI Assistant
instructions: |
  You are a helpful assistant.
```

**Problem**: Special characters in strings
```yaml
# ‚ùå Wrong - unescaped special characters
name: AI Assistant: "Advanced" Edition

# ‚úÖ Correct - properly quoted
name: 'AI Assistant: "Advanced" Edition'
```

**Problem**: Invalid array syntax
```yaml
# ‚ùå Wrong - mixing syntaxes
tools: ["file_search", code_interpreter]

# ‚úÖ Correct - consistent array syntax
tools: ["file_search", "code_interpreter"]
```

#### Schema Validation Errors

**Problem**: Missing required properties
```yaml
# ‚ùå Missing required fields
version: 1.0.0
name: My Agent

# ‚úÖ Complete required fields
version: 1.0.0
name: My Agent
tools: []
description: Agent description
instructions: |
  Agent instructions here
```

**Problem**: Invalid property values
```yaml
# ‚ùå Invalid tool name
tools: ["filesearch"]  # Wrong spelling

# ‚úÖ Correct tool names
tools: ["file_search", "code_interpreter"]
```

**Problem**: Out-of-range values
```yaml
# ‚ùå Temperature outside valid range
model:
  options:
    temperature: 2.0  # Must be 0.0-1.0

# ‚úÖ Valid temperature
model:
  options:
    temperature: 0.7
```

### Deployment Issues

#### Authentication Problems

**Problem**: Azure CLI not authenticated
```bash
# Error: "Please run 'az login' to authenticate"

# Solution: Login to Azure
az login

# Verify authentication
az account show
```

**Problem**: Insufficient permissions
```bash
# Error: "User does not have permission to access resource"

# Solution: Check required permissions
az role assignment list --assignee $(az account show --query user.name -o tsv)

# Request Cognitive Services Contributor role
az role assignment create \
  --assignee "user@domain.com" \
  --role "Cognitive Services Contributor" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{rg-name}"
```

#### Endpoint Issues

**Problem**: Invalid AI Foundry endpoint
```bash
# Error: "Could not connect to AI Foundry endpoint"

# Solution: Verify endpoint format
# Correct format: https://{resource-name}.cognitiveservices.azure.com/api/projects/{project-name}

# Find your endpoint
az cognitiveservices account show \
  --name "your-ai-foundry-name" \
  --resource-group "your-rg" \
  --query "properties.endpoint" \
  --output tsv
```

**Problem**: Agent deployment script not found
```bash
# Error: "Agent deployment script not found: infra/agent_deploy.ps1"

# Solution: Verify script exists and is executable
ls -la infra/agent_deploy.ps1
chmod +x infra/agent_deploy.ps1

# Or check project structure
find . -name "*agent*" -type f
```

#### Model and Configuration Issues

**Problem**: Model not available
```yaml
# Error during deployment about invalid model ID

# Solution: Check available models in your region
az cognitiveservices account list-models \
  --name "your-ai-foundry-name" \
  --resource-group "your-rg" \
  --query "[].{Name:name, Version:version}" \
  --output table

# Use correct model ID
model:
  id: gpt-4o-mini  # Verify this model is available
```

**Problem**: Tool configuration not working
```yaml
# File search not returning results

# Check tool is properly enabled
tools: ["file_search"]  # Must be exact spelling

# Verify files are uploaded to AI Foundry project
# Check in Azure AI Foundry portal under Files section
```

### Agent Behavior Issues

#### Inconsistent Responses

**Problem**: Agent doesn't follow instructions consistently

**Diagnosis**:
```yaml
# Check instruction clarity and specificity
instructions: |
  # ‚ùå Vague instruction
  Be helpful.
  
  # ‚úÖ Specific instruction
  You are a customer support agent. Always:
  1. Acknowledge the customer's issue
  2. Ask clarifying questions if needed
  3. Provide step-by-step solutions
  4. Offer additional help
```

**Solution**: Refine instructions with specific behavioral guidelines and examples.

#### Poor Response Quality

**Problem**: Responses are too generic or unhelpful

**Diagnosis**:
```yaml
# Check temperature and model settings
model:
  id: gpt-35-turbo     # May need more capable model
  options:
    temperature: 0.9   # May be too high for factual responses

# Solution: Adjust parameters
model:
  id: gpt-4o-mini      # More capable model
  options:
    temperature: 0.3   # Lower temperature for consistency
```

**Additional Solutions**:
- Add more specific domain knowledge to instructions
- Include examples of good responses in instructions
- Use file_search tool with relevant documentation
- Provide more context about user needs and expectations

#### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Slow response times

**Diagnosis**:
- Check model selection (larger models are slower)
- Verify tool usage (file_search and code_interpreter add latency)
- Review instruction length (very long instructions slow processing)

**Solutions**:
```yaml
# Use faster model for simple tasks
model:
  id: gpt-4o-mini  # Faster than gpt-4o

# Optimize tool configuration
file_search:
  max_num_results: 10  # Reduce from default 20

code_interpreter:
  timeout_seconds: 60  # Reduce timeout if appropriate

# Streamline instructions (remove unnecessary content)
instructions: |
  # Keep instructions focused and concise
  # Remove example conversations if they're very long
```

#### Security and Compliance Issues

**Problem**: Agent sharing sensitive information

**Solution**:
```yaml
instructions: |
  SECURITY GUIDELINES:
  - Never share passwords, API keys, or credentials
  - Don't provide information about other customers or users
  - If asked for sensitive data, explain why you can't provide it
  - Escalate security-related questions to appropriate teams
  
  If unsure about sharing information, err on the side of caution and escalate.
```

**Problem**: Agent not following compliance requirements

**Solution**:
```yaml
instructions: |
  COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS:
  - Follow GDPR data protection principles
  - Don't store or remember personal information between sessions
  - Provide data subject rights information when requested
  - Log interactions for audit purposes only
  
  When handling personal data:
  1. Only process what's necessary for the task
  2. Explain how the data will be used
  3. Don't retain data beyond the current session
```

### Monitoring and Debugging

#### Enable Detailed Logging

```bash
# Check Application Insights for detailed telemetry
az monitor app-insights component show \
  --app "your-app-insights" \
  --resource-group "your-rg"

# View recent errors
az monitor app-insights query \
  --app "your-app-insights" \
  --analytics-query "traces | where severityLevel >= 2 | order by timestamp desc | limit 50"
```

#### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor response times and success rates
az monitor app-insights query \
  --app "your-app-insights" \
  --analytics-query "
    requests 
    | where timestamp > ago(24h)
    | where name contains 'chat'
    | summarize 
        AvgDuration = avg(duration),
        SuccessRate = avg(todouble(success)) * 100,
        RequestCount = count()
    by bin(timestamp, 1h)
    | order by timestamp desc"
```

#### User Feedback Collection

```yaml
# Add feedback collection to agent instructions
instructions: |
  At the end of complex responses, ask:
  "Was this helpful? If not, please let me know what additional information would be useful."
  
  Keep track of common follow-up questions to improve your responses.
```

- If you don't know something, [fallback behavior]

FORMATTING:
- Use bullet points for lists
- Include relevant links when helpful
- Keep responses concise but thorough"
```

## üîß Feature Customization

### Add Custom API Endpoints

**Location:** `src/backend/Functions/`

**Create new Function:**
```csharp
// CustomApiFunction.cs
[Function("CustomApi")]
public async Task<HttpResponseData> RunCustomApi(
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post", Route = "custom")] HttpRequestData req)
{
    var logger = req.FunctionContext.GetLogger("CustomApi");
    
    // Your custom logic here
    var requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
    var customResult = ProcessCustomRequest(requestBody);
    
    var response = req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
    await response.WriteAsJsonAsync(customResult);
    return response;
}

private object ProcessCustomRequest(string requestBody)
{
    // Implement your custom business logic
    return new { result = "Custom processing complete", timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow };
}
```

**Update Frontend to Use Custom API:**
```javascript
// src/frontend/src/services/customApi.js
export class CustomApiService {
    constructor(baseUrl) {
        this.baseUrl = baseUrl;
    }

    async callCustomEndpoint(data) {
        const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/custom`, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            },
            body: JSON.stringify(data)
        });

        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`Custom API error: ${response.statusText}`);
        }

        return await response.json();
    }
}
```

### Add Authentication

**For Enterprise Use Cases:**

**1. Update Frontend:**
```javascript
// src/frontend/src/auth/authService.js
import { PublicClientApplication } from '@azure/msal-browser';

const msalConfig = {
    auth: {
        clientId: 'your-app-registration-client-id',
        authority: 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/your-tenant-id'
    }
};

export class AuthService {
    constructor() {
        this.msalInstance = new PublicClientApplication(msalConfig);
    }

    async login() {
        const result = await this.msalInstance.loginPopup();
        return result.accessToken;
    }

    async getToken() {
        const accounts = this.msalInstance.getAllAccounts();
        if (accounts.length > 0) {
            const result = await this.msalInstance.acquireTokenSilent({
                scopes: ['https://your-api.com/.default'],
                account: accounts[0]
            });
            return result.accessToken;
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

**2. Update Backend:**
```csharp
// Add authentication to Function App
[Function("ChatWithAuth")]
public async Task<HttpResponseData> RunWithAuth(
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post")] HttpRequestData req)
{
    // Validate JWT token
    var token = req.Headers.GetValues("Authorization").FirstOrDefault()?.Replace("Bearer ", "");
    var user = await ValidateTokenAsync(token);
    
    if (user == null)
    {
        var unauthorizedResponse = req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized);
        return unauthorizedResponse;
    }

    // Continue with authenticated request
    // ...
}
```

### Add File Upload Support

**Backend Function:**
```csharp
[Function("FileUpload")]
public async Task<HttpResponseData> UploadFile(
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post", Route = "upload")] HttpRequestData req)
{
    var formData = await MultipartFormDataParser.ParseAsync(req.Body);
    var file = formData.Files.FirstOrDefault();
    
    if (file != null)
    {
        // Process file (save to blob storage, analyze content, etc.)
        var blobClient = new BlobClient("connection-string", "container", file.FileName);
        await blobClient.UploadAsync(file.Data);
        
        // Optionally send file content to AI for analysis
        var fileAnalysis = await AnalyzeFileWithAI(file);
        
        var response = req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
        await response.WriteAsJsonAsync(new { 
            fileName = file.FileName, 
            analysis = fileAnalysis 
        });
        return response;
    }
    
    var badResponse = req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);
    return badResponse;
}
```

**Frontend Component:**
```javascript
// File upload component
export class FileUploadComponent {
    constructor(apiService) {
        this.apiService = apiService;
    }

    async uploadFile(file) {
        const formData = new FormData();
        formData.append('file', file);

        const response = await fetch(`${this.apiService.baseUrl}/upload`, {
            method: 'POST',
            body: formData
        });

        return await response.json();
    }

    createUploadUI() {
        return `
            <div class="file-upload">
                <input type="file" id="fileInput" accept=".pdf,.doc,.txt">
                <button onclick="this.handleUpload()">Upload and Analyze</button>
            </div>
        `;
    }
}
```

## üé® Advanced UI Customization

### Add Dark Mode

**CSS Variables for Theme Switching:**
```css
/* Light theme (default) */
:root {
  --bg-primary: #ffffff;
  --bg-secondary: #f8f9fa;
  --text-primary: #212529;
  --text-secondary: #6c757d;
  --border-color: #dee2e6;
}

/* Dark theme */
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --bg-primary: #1a1a1a;
  --bg-secondary: #2d2d2d;
  --text-primary: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: #b0b0b0;
  --border-color: #404040;
}

/* Apply theme variables */
body {
  background-color: var(--bg-primary);
  color: var(--text-primary);
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease;
}
```

**Theme Toggle Component:**
```javascript
export class ThemeToggle {
    constructor() {
        this.currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light';
        this.applyTheme();
    }

    toggle() {
        this.currentTheme = this.currentTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light';
        this.applyTheme();
        localStorage.setItem('theme', this.currentTheme);
    }

    applyTheme() {
        document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', this.currentTheme);
    }

    createToggleButton() {
        return `
            <button class="theme-toggle" onclick="themeToggle.toggle()">
                ${this.currentTheme === 'light' ? 'üåô' : '‚òÄÔ∏è'}
            </button>
        `;
    }
}
```

### Add Typing Indicators

**JavaScript Implementation:**
```javascript
export class TypingIndicator {
    constructor(container) {
        this.container = container;
    }

    show() {
        const indicator = document.createElement('div');
        indicator.className = 'typing-indicator';
        indicator.innerHTML = `
            <div class="typing-dots">
                <span></span>
                <span></span>
                <span></span>
            </div>
        `;
        this.container.appendChild(indicator);
    }

    hide() {
        const indicator = this.container.querySelector('.typing-indicator');
        if (indicator) {
            indicator.remove();
        }
    }
}
```

**CSS Animation:**
```css
.typing-indicator {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 5px 0;
}

.typing-dots {
    display: flex;
    gap: 4px;
}

.typing-dots span {
    width: 8px;
    height: 8px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    background-color: var(--text-secondary);
    animation: typing 1.4s infinite;
}

.typing-dots span:nth-child(2) {
    animation-delay: 0.2s;
}

.typing-dots span:nth-child(3) {
    animation-delay: 0.4s;
}

@keyframes typing {
    0%, 60%, 100% {
        transform: translateY(0);
        opacity: 0.5;
    }
    30% {
        transform: translateY(-10px);
        opacity: 1;
    }
}
```

## üîß Configuration Customization

### Environment-Specific Settings

**Create custom environment configs:**
```javascript
// src/frontend/environments/custom.js
export const environment = {
    production: true,
    apiBaseUrl: 'https://your-custom-domain.com/api',
    aiFoundryEndpoint: 'https://your-ai-foundry.cognitiveservices.azure.com/',
    agentName: 'Your Custom Agent',
    
    // Custom features
    enableFileUpload: true,
    enableDarkMode: true,
    enableAuthentication: true,
    maxMessageLength: 2000,
    
    // Branding
    companyName: 'Your Company',
    logoUrl: '/assets/your-logo.png',
    primaryColor: '#your-brand-color',
    
    // Feature flags
    features: {
        voiceInput: false,
        messageExport: true,
        conversationHistory: true
    }
};
```

### Custom Deployment Scripts

**Create environment-specific deployment:**
```powershell
# deploy-custom.ps1
param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]$Environment,
    
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]$CustomDomain,
    
    [string]$AgentName = "Your Custom Agent"
)

# Set environment-specific variables
$ResourcePrefix = "your-company-ai"
$Location = if ($Environment -eq "prod") { "eastus2" } else { "centralus" }

# Deploy with custom parameters
az deployment sub create `
    --template-file "infra/main-orchestrator.bicep" `
    --parameters `
        "applicationName=$ResourcePrefix" `
        "environmentName=$Environment" `
        "location=$Location" `
        "aiFoundryAgentName=$AgentName" `
        "customDomainName=$CustomDomain"

# Custom post-deployment configuration
./scripts/configure-custom-domain.ps1 -Domain $CustomDomain
./scripts/setup-monitoring.ps1 -Environment $Environment
```

## üì± Mobile Responsiveness

### Optimize for Mobile

**Responsive CSS:**
```css
/* Mobile-first approach */
.chat-container {
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

/* Tablet and up */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .chat-container {
        max-width: 800px;
        margin: 0 auto;
        height: 80vh;
        border-radius: 12px;
        box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
    }
}

/* Mobile input adjustments */
@media (max-width: 767px) {
    .input-container {
        padding: 10px;
        position: fixed;
        bottom: 0;
        left: 0;
        right: 0;
        background: var(--bg-primary);
        border-top: 1px solid var(--border-color);
    }
    
    .message-input {
        font-size: 16px; /* Prevents zoom on iOS */
        min-height: 44px; /* Touch target size */
    }
}
```

### Touch-Friendly Features

**Swipe Gestures:**
```javascript
export class TouchGestures {
    constructor(element) {
        this.element = element;
        this.startX = 0;
        this.startY = 0;
        
        element.addEventListener('touchstart', this.handleTouchStart.bind(this));
        element.addEventListener('touchmove', this.handleTouchMove.bind(this));
        element.addEventListener('touchend', this.handleTouchEnd.bind(this));
    }

    handleTouchStart(e) {
        this.startX = e.touches[0].clientX;
        this.startY = e.touches[0].clientY;
    }

    handleTouchMove(e) {
        // Prevent default scrolling behavior when needed
        if (this.isHorizontalSwipe(e)) {
            e.preventDefault();
        }
    }

    handleTouchEnd(e) {
        const endX = e.changedTouches[0].clientX;
        const endY = e.changedTouches[0].clientY;
        
        const deltaX = endX - this.startX;
        const deltaY = endY - this.startY;
        
        // Detect swipe direction
        if (Math.abs(deltaX) > Math.abs(deltaY) && Math.abs(deltaX) > 50) {
            if (deltaX > 0) {
                this.onSwipeRight();
            } else {
                this.onSwipeLeft();
            }
        }
    }

    onSwipeRight() {
        // Show conversation history
        this.showSidebar();
    }

    onSwipeLeft() {
        // Hide conversation history
        this.hideSidebar();
    }
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment Customization

### Custom Domain Setup

**DNS Configuration:**
```bash
# Add CNAME record pointing to Static Web App
# your-domain.com -> your-static-app.azurestaticapps.net

# Configure custom domain in Azure
az staticwebapp hostname set \
    --name "your-static-app" \
    --resource-group "your-rg" \
    --hostname "ai.your-domain.com"
```

**SSL Certificate:**
```bash
# Azure automatically provides SSL for custom domains
# Or use your own certificate
az staticwebapp hostname set \
    --name "your-static-app" \
    --resource-group "your-rg" \
    --hostname "ai.your-domain.com" \
    --certificate-source "your-certificate"
```
