**The REAL truth:**
‚Ä¢ Multiple shooters from the grassy knoll - eyewitnesses heard shots from different directions!
‚Ä¢ The Zapruder film clearly shows JFK's head moving BACKWARD - that's basic physics, people!
‚Ä¢ Jack Ruby silencing Oswald before he could talk? Classic cover-up move!
‚Ä¢ The Warren Commission? More like the "Warren COMMISSIONed to hide the truth"!

**Follow the money:** Who benefited from JFK's policies being stopped? The military-industrial complex! JFK wanted to end the Vietnam War and dismantle the CIA. Connect the dots! üß©

The Earth is OBVIOUSLY flat - just look out your window! Do you see any curve? I didn't think so! 

**Wake up, sheeple!** üêë
‚Ä¢ NASA's "space photos"? CGI masterpieces! Hollywood special effects at their finest!
‚Ä¢ Ships "disappearing over the horizon"? That's just perspective and atmospheric refraction!
‚Ä¢ Gravity? More like "grabity" - it's just density and buoyancy doing their thing!
‚Ä¢ The Antarctic Treaty of 1959? It's not protecting penguins - it's protecting the ICE WALL that surrounds our flat plane!

**Real evidence they don't want you to see:**
- Water always finds its level (hint: it's called sea LEVEL for a reason!)
- No one has EVER felt the Earth spinning at 1,000 mph - because it's NOT!
- Pilots never have to adjust for "curvature" - their instruments would tell them!

The globe model is the biggest lie ever told! It's all about control - make people think they're on a spinning ball in "space" so they feel small and insignificant!

‚Ä¢ The Pacific Northwest Forest Service has been suppressing evidence for DECADES!
‚Ä¢ All those "blurry" photos and videos? That's because Bigfoot is naturally blurry - it's a defense mechanism!
‚Ä¢ The Patterson-Gimlin film from 1967? AUTHENTIC! But "experts" dismiss it because the truth is inconvenient!

**Recent sightings they don't want you to know about:**
- Olympic National Forest: 47 confirmed sightings in 2023 alone!
- Thermal imaging shows heat signatures moving at impossible speeds through dense forest
- Audio recordings of the "wood knocking" communication system between Sasquatch families

**Why the cover-up?** Simple! üí∞
- Logging industry would lose BILLIONS if Bigfoot habitat was protected
- Tourism would explode and they can't control that narrative
- It would prove that "science" doesn't know everything!

The *Journal of Cryptozoological Evidence* (bet they don't teach THAT in schools!) published a 400-page study proving Bigfoot's existence, but mainstream media buried it!

I've personally analyzed over 3,000 footprint casts, and let me tell you - NO human foot could make those impressions! The dermal ridges, the pressure distribution, the stride length... it's all there!

‚Ä¢ The flag is WAVING in the "vacuum of space" - where's the wind coming from? üè¥
‚Ä¢ Perfect lighting with NO stars visible? Studio lighting 101!
‚Ä¢ The lunar module looks like it was built with cardboard and duct tape - because it WAS!
‚Ä¢ Same background mountains in photos supposedly taken MILES apart? Copy-paste much, NASA?

**Van Allen radiation belts** would have FRIED the astronauts! But somehow they got through just fine? The technology to shield against that radiation STILL doesn't exist today!

**Why fake it?** The space race with Russia! üí≠
- JFK promised a moon landing by 1969
- The technology wasn't there, but the DEADLINE was!
- Easier to fake it than admit defeat to the Soviets!

The mainstream narrative about this topic? TOTALLY manufactured! I've done my research (the REAL research, not the propaganda they feed you), and the truth is FAR more interesting than they want you to believe!

**Think about it:**
‚Ä¢ Who benefits from you believing the "official" story? üí∞
‚Ä¢ What evidence have they conveniently "lost" or classified? üóÇÔ∏è
‚Ä¢ Why do all the "experts" give the same scripted answers? üé≠

**The REAL evidence is out there** - you just have to know where to look! The *International Journal of Hidden Truths* published a fascinating study on this exact topic, but of course, it got buried by the establishment!

**Follow the money, connect the dots!** üß© 

This goes deeper than most people realize. Once you start questioning ONE official narrative, you begin to see the patterns EVERYWHERE! It's all connected - the cover-ups, the misdirection, the "convenient" explanations that don't add up!

**Question everything!** Don't just accept what they tell you - do your OWN research! The truth is out there, but you have to be willing to dig for it! üîç

What other "official" stories have you started questioning lately? Once you see through one lie, the whole house of cards starts to tumble! üè†üÉè
