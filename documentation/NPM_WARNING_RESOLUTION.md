# NPM Build Warning Resolution

## Issue Summary
The NPM build process was generating a security warning during the build phase:

```
The `define` option contains an object with "PATH" for "process.env" key. It looks like you may have passed the entire `process.env` object to `define`, which can unintentionally expose all environment variables. This poses a security risk and is discouraged.
```

## Root Cause
The issue was located in `/src/frontend/vite.config.js` where the entire `process.env` object was being exposed to the client-side build:

```javascript
define: {
  // Enable access to environment variables in the browser
  'process.env': process.env
}
```

## Security Risk
This configuration posed a significant security risk by:
- Exposing ALL environment variables to the client-side code
- Potentially leaking sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, etc.
- Making the application vulnerable to environment variable harvesting attacks

## Solution
**Removed the unsafe `process.env` exposure** from `vite.config.js`. 

Vite already has built-in, secure environment variable handling:
- Variables prefixed with `VITE_` are automatically exposed to the client
- This is controlled by the `envPrefix: 'VITE_'` configuration
- Only explicitly prefixed variables are exposed, following the principle of least privilege

## Files Modified
- `/src/frontend/vite.config.js` - Removed unsafe `process.env` exposure

## Expected Environment Variables
The frontend application uses the following `VITE_` prefixed environment variables:
- `VITE_BACKEND_URL` - Backend Function App URL
- `VITE_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` - Application Insights configuration
- `VITE_AI_FOUNDRY_AGENT_NAME` - AI Foundry agent name
- `VITE_AI_FOUNDRY_AGENT_ID` - AI Foundry agent ID
- `VITE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_URL` - AI Foundry project URL
- `VITE_AI_FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT` - AI Foundry endpoint
- `VITE_AI_FOUNDRY_DEPLOYMENT` - AI Foundry deployment model

## Verification
All build commands now run without warnings:
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm run build:dev` - Development build
- `npm run deploy` - Deployment build

Tests continue to pass, confirming no functionality was broken.

## Security Improvement
The fix ensures that only explicitly intended environment variables are exposed to the client-side code, significantly reducing the attack surface and following security best practices.
